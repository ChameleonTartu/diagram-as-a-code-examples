# Diagrams-as-a-code

This is project presents concept "Diagram as a Code", so architecture can be written with Python code.

## Proc & Cons of using diagrams as a code
**Pros:**
- Standardize tooling required for drawing architecture diagrams
- The code can be stored/reversed in git

**Cons:**
- Allows customization of components, so different team can represent the same components differently
- You need to have Python installed and basic understanding of Python

## Plan of presentation

- Intro in what is Diagram as a code, show of Python `diagrams` library
- Intro into a syntax and available components, documentation, GitHub project etc.
- Show use-case #1 On-prem + AWS + Google Suite
- Show use-case #2 AWS + GCP
- Show use-case #3: Discovery API and other custom DNB components
- Optional: Show tooling around to simplify and improve development such as `bandit`, `isort`, `flake8`.
